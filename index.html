            <h3>Nepal halted Visit Nepal 2020</h3>
            <img src="./picture/fewa.jpg" height="250 px"><br>
            <i class="news">Kathmandu, 31/10/2020</i>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">The government has formally cancelled the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign, a month after its
                 major promotional activities in the overseas markets were halted, in the wake of the Covid-19 global pandemic. 
                 Nepal itself is currently under lockdown starting March 24, and it has been extended until April 7 midnight.
                Kedar Bahadur Adhikari, secretary at the Tourism Ministry, told the Post that last Sunday's (March 22) cabinet
                 meeting decided to call off the campaign that aimed to draw 2 million tourists in the country this year.
                "Similarly, the meeting also decided to dissolve the Visit Nepal Secretariat with effect from April 13," he said.
                 On March 1, despite Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s instruction to the Tourism Ministry to postpone the Visit Nepal 2020,
                  the high-level committee for the control and prevention of Covid-19, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokhrel,
                   decided to halt the campaign until April. The decision had led to the confusion among tourism entrepreneurs hi, as
                    the government did not officially announce whether the tourism campaign was cancelled, postponed or continued.

                 and airport upgradation, and reconstruction of historical monuments and cultural heritage sites.
                 But the 2020 campaign was embroiled in controversy from the very beginning with entrepreneurs saying the 
                 campaign was bound to fail. The position of chief of the Tourism Board remained vacant for much of January, 
                 even after the campaign was launched with much fanfare on the first of the month. But things had started going
                  downhill much earlier.
